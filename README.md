# HeartDiseaseDetection
A Machine Learning-powered web application for predicting heart disease using Logistic Regression. Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, this project provides insights into model performance and predictions based on user inputs.

🚀 Overview
HeartShield is a Machine Learning-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes. This project uses a Logistic Regression model for prediction and employs Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.

📂 Project Structure

app.py: The main application script containing the model training, testing, and web interface code.
heart_disease_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
heart_img.jpg: An image of the human heart displayed on the web application.

📊 Model Description

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, streamlit
